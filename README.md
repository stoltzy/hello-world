# hello-world
Let's see what we can do

My name is Jason Stoltzfus and I am working on transferring out of Client Services. I've been with Frontline for 3 years and have worked my way to a Senior Support position on the Absence & Time Solution. I originally graduated from College in 2013 with a degree in Management of Information Technology, but have not had the opportunity to fully utilize my IT knowledge in my Career. The goal of this is to grow myself through professional dvevelopment and gain some experience with automated testing and QA.
